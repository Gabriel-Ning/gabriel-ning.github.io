<b><i>Abstract: </i></b> Integrating global visual planning and local tactile feedback provides comprehensive supervision and control over the welding process, enhancing the system's precision and adaptability. Our presented robotic welding system offers opportunities for improvement, such as refining spatial welding path based on the designed tactile sensor, improving the accuracy of corrective actions through the use of machine learning algorithms, and more. <b><i>(WIP)</i></b>
